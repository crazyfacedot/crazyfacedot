 # Hello, I’m @crazyfacedot (AKA Georgia)
 I have just started to learn code in the summer of 2023, and I have just released my first [website](https://crazyfacedot.github.io/cooking-with-g/) through GITHUB! 
 
- I’m interested in cooking 🥧 , hiking 🍂 and learning new skills👩‍💻
- I've only just started to learn basic HTML and CSS and will be moving onto Java very soon
- I’m looking to start my career in the technology world 🖥️
